# CoinLizard

CoinLizard is a project developed by Renaldy Lewa, aimed at providing functionalities similar to Coingecko/Coinmarketcap. It was developed with a tech stack including React.js, Java, Java Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring WebSocket, Maven, Selenium (Python), Docker and PostgreSQL.

## Features

- **Coin Details**: Provides detailed information about various cryptocurrencies.
- **Chat Room**: Allows users to engage in discussions related to cryptocurrencies.
- **Currency Conversion**: Enables users to convert between different currencies.
- **Cryptocurrency News**: Offers the latest news and updates about cryptocurrencies and CRUD operation for those news.
- **List of NFT**: Provides detailed information about various NFTs.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js and React Frameworks**: Used for building the frontend user interface.
- **Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring WebSocket**: Employed for developing the backend server with multiple endpoints and WebSocket functionality.
- **Maven**: Utilized as the build automation tool and package manager for Java projects.
- **Selenium (Python)**: Implemented for automated web testing.
- **PostgreSQL**: Used as the relational database management system.
- **Docker**: Used with the aim for Consistent Development Environment,  Portability, Scalability, Dependency Management and Version Control and Collaboration.

## API Integration

CoinLizard integrates multiple APIs to fetch data from different sources such as Coingecko's API and CoinCap's API. These APIs provide essential cryptocurrency data, facilitating the functionalities of the application.

## Development Highlights

- Implemented a robust backend using Spring Boot, providing various endpoints and supporting WebSocket communication.
- Leveraged React.js to build an interactive and user-friendly frontend.
- Integrated Selenium for automated web testing, ensuring the reliability of the application.
- Utilized PostgreSQL for database management, supporting CRUD operations and storing essential data.
- Used Docker with the aim for Consistent Development Environment,  Portability, Scalability, Dependency Management and Version Control and Collaboration.

CoinLizard serves as a comprehensive platform for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, offering essential information, discussions, and news in one centralized location.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
